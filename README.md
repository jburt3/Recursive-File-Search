# recursiveFileSearch

This repository contains a Java program that allows a user to recursively search a given directory for a target file or 
directory. If successful, The program will return the absolute path to the requested target.

Once launched, the user shall be prompted to supply an absolute path. The user shall then be prompted to provide a target 
file or directory to find. If the search is successful, the absolute path shall be returned. If the search is unsuccessful,
however, an error message shall be returned. Once the result is returned, the user shall be able to search for another file
by typing "y", or terminate the program by typing "n" once prompted.
